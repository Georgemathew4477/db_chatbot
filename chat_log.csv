2025-06-19 01:35:44,What foods should I avoid with type 2 diabetes," With Type 2 diabetes, it is advisable to avoid or limit the following types of food:

1. Foods high in saturated and trans fats, such as butter, lard, cream, hard cheeses, pastries, biscuits, cakes, sausages, and fatty cuts of meat.

2. High-sugar foods and drinks, including sweets, desserts, sugar-sweetened beverages, and candies. Instead, opt for low-fat dairy products and fresh fruits when wanting something sweet.

3. Processed and packaged foods, as they often contain high levels of added sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats.

4. Refined grains like white bread, pasta, and rice, which have a high glycemic index and can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. Choose whole grains instead.

5. Foods with added salt, as people with diabetes are at an increased risk of developing hypertension. Try to reduce your sodium intake by preparing meals at home using fresh ingredients.

6. Alcohol should be consumed in moderation, as it can lead to weight gain and affect blood sugar control. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit your intake to no more than one or two drinks per day.",ðŸŸ  AMBER â€“ Possibly correct but unverified,"nhs_guidance.txt: ] 1.3.3 Encourage adults with type 2 diabetes to follow the same healthy eating advice as the general population, which includes: â€¢ eating high-fibre, | nhs_guidance.txt: with type 2 diabetes, think about and discuss the following with the person: â€¢ how to optimise their current treatment regimen before thinking about c | nhs_guidance.txt: ing insulin or an insulin secretagogue.
