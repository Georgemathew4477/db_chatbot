Diabetes (type 1 and type 2)
in children and young
people: diagnosis and
management


Blood glucose and plasma glucose
'Blood glucose' is the more commonly used term. However, a lot of the evidence this
guideline is based on uses 'plasma' rather than 'blood' glucose, and patient-held glucose
meters and monitoring systems are calibrated to plasma glucose equivalents. Because of
this, in this guideline we use the term 'blood glucose', except when referring to specific
concentration values.
1.1 Diagnosis 

1.1.1 Be aware that signs of type 1 diabetes in children and young people include:
• hyperglycaemia (random plasma glucose more than 11 mmol/litre)
• polyuria
• polydipsia
• weight loss
• excessive tiredness. [2004, amended 2015]
1.1.2 Refer children and young people with suspected type 1 diabetes immediately (on
the same day) to a multidisciplinary paediatric diabetes team with the
competencies needed to confirm diagnosis and provide immediate care. [2004,amended 2015]
1.1.3 Confirm type 1 diabetes in children and young people using the plasma glucose
criteria in the World Health Organization's 2006 report on the diagnosis and
classification of diabetes mellitus. [2004, amended 2015]
1.1.4 When diagnosing diabetes in a child or young person, assume type 1 diabetes
unless there are strong indications of type 2 diabetes, monogenic or
mitochondrial diabetes. [2015]
1.1.5 Think about the possibility of type 2 diabetes in children and young people with
suspected diabetes who:
• have a strong family history of type 2 diabetes
• are obese
• are from a Black or Asian family background
• do not need insulin, or need less than 0.5 units/kg body weight/day after the
partial remission phase
• show evidence of insulin resistance (for example, acanthosis nigricans).
[2004, amended 2015] 

1.1.6 Think about the possibility of other types of diabetes (not type 1 or 2), such as
other insulin-resistance syndromes, or monogenic or mitochondrial diabetes, in
children and young people with suspected diabetes who have any of the
following:
• diabetes in the first year of life
• rarely or never develop ketones in the blood (ketonaemia) during episodes of
hyperglycaemia
• associated features, such as optic atrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, deafness, or
another systemic illness or syndrome. [2004, amended 2015]
1.1.7 Do not measure C-peptide or diabetes-specific autoantibody titres at initial
presentation to distinguish type 1 diabetes from type 2 diabetes. [2015] 

1.1.8 Consider measuring C-peptide after initial presentation if needed to distinguish
between type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes. Be aware that C-peptide
concentrations have better discriminative value the longer the interval between
initial presentation and the test. [2015]
1.1.9 Perform genetic testing if atypical disease behaviour, clinical characteristics or
family history suggest monogenic diabetes. [2015]


Type 2 diabetes 

Education and information
1.3.1 When giving children and young people, or their families or carers, information
about type 2 diabetes:
• tailor the timing, content and delivery of information to their needs and
preferences, paying particular attention to people with additional needs such
as autistic people or those with learning disabilities, people who have
physical or sensory disabilities and people who have difficulties speaking or
reading English
• ensure that the information given supports shared decision making between
the child or young person and the multidisciplinary diabetes team.
Follow the recommendation in NICE's guideline on shared decision making
and babies, children and young people's experience of healthcare. [2023]
1.3.2 Offer children and young people with type 2 diabetes and their families or carers
a continuing programme of education from diagnosis. Include the following core
topics:
• the importance of managing glucose levels, including achieving and
maintaining glucose and HbA1c targets
• how and when to take capillary blood glucose measurements (selfDiabetes (type 1 and type 2) in children and young people: diagnosis and management

• how diet, increasing physical activity and reducing body weight can reduce
the symptoms of type 2 diabetes and lead to remission
• how diet, physical activity, body weight and intercurrent illness affects blood
glucose levels
• how metformin can help, and its possible adverse effects
• the complications of type 2 diabetes and how to prevent them.

1.3.3 Tailor the education programme to each child or young person with
type 2 diabetes and their families or carers, taking account of issues such as:
• personal preferences
• emotional wellbeing
• age and maturity
• cultural considerations
• existing knowledge
• current and future social circumstances
• life goals. [2015]
1.3.4 Give children and young people with type 2 diabetes who are taking insulin, and
their families or carers, information and education about:
• insulin therapy (including its aims and how it works) 
• insulin delivery (including rotating injection sites within the same body region)
• dosage adjustment
• the recognition and management of hypoglycaemia
• the importance of monitoring their glucose levels. [2023]
1.3.5 Give children and young people with type 2 diabetes who are offered continuous
glucose monitoring (CGM), and their families and carers, information about how
to use their chosen device, as part of their continuing programme of education.
[2023]
1.3.6 Explain to children and young people with type 2 diabetes and their families or
carers that, like people without diabetes, they should have: 
• regular dental examinations (see the NICE guideline on dental checks:
intervals between oral health reviews)
• an eye examination by an optician every 2 years. [2004, amended 2015]
1.3.7 Encourage children and young people with type 2 diabetes and their families or
carers to discuss any concerns and raise any questions they have with their
diabetes team. [2015]
1.3.8 Give children and young people with type 2 diabetes and their families or carers
information about diabetes support groups and organisations, and the potential
benefits of membership. Give this information after diagnosis and regularly
afterwards. [2004, amended 2015]
1.3.9 Explain to children and young people with type 2 diabetes and their families or
carers how to find out about possible government disability benefits. [2004,
amended 2015] 
Smoking and substance misuse
1.3.10 Encourage children and young people with type 2 diabetes not to start smoking.
Explain the general health problems smoking causes, in particular the risks of
vascular complications. [2004, amended 2015]
1.3.11 For more guidance on preventing smoking, see also the NICE guideline on
tobacco: preventing uptake, promoting quitting and treating dependence. [2004,
amended 2015]
1.3.12 Offer smoking cessation programmes to children and young people with
type 2 diabetes who smoke. See also the NICE guideline on tobacco: preventing
uptake, promoting quitting and treating dependence. [2004, amended 2015]
1.3.13 Explain to children and young people with type 2 diabetes and their families or
carers about the general dangers of substance misuse and the possible effects
on blood glucose levels. [2004, amended 2015] 
Immunisation
1.3.14 Explain to children and young people with type 2 diabetes and their families or
carers that the UK Health Security Agency Green Book recommends they have:
• annual immunisation against influenza
• immunisation against pneumococcal infection if they are taking insulin or oral
hypoglycaemic medicines. [2004, amended 2015] 
Dietary management
1.3.15 At each contact with a child or young person with type 2 diabetes who is
overweight or obese, advise them and their families or carers about the benefits
of exercise and weight loss, and provide support towards achieving this. See also
the NICE guideline on overweight and obesity management. [2015]
1.3.16 Offer children and young people with type 2 diabetes dietetic support to help
optimise body weight and blood glucose levels. [2004, amended 2015]
1.3.17 At each contact with a child or young person with type 2 diabetes, explain to
them and their families or carers how healthy eating can help to:
• reduce hyperglycaemia
• reduce cardiovascular risk
• promote weight loss (see recommendation 1.3.15). [2015]
1.3.18 Provide dietary advice to children and young people with type 2 diabetes and
their families or carers in a sensitive manner. Take into account the difficulties
that many people have with losing weight, and how healthy eating can also help
with blood glucose levels and avoiding complications. [2015]
1.3.19 Take into account social and cultural considerations when providing dietary
advice to children and young people with type 2 diabetes. [2015]
1.3.20 Encourage children and young people with type 2 diabetes to eat at least
5 portions of fruit and vegetables each day. [2015]
1.3.21 At each clinic visit for children and young people with type 2 diabetes:
• measure height and weight and plot on an appropriate growth chart
• calculate body mass index.
Check for normal growth or significant changes in weight because these may
reflect changes in blood glucose levels. [2004, amended 2015] 
1.3.22 Provide arrangements for weighing children and young people with
type 2 diabetes that respect their privacy. [2004, amended 2015] 
At diagnosis
1.3.23 Refer children and young people with suspected type 2 diabetes to a
multidisciplinary paediatric diabetes team for specialist review to:
• confirm diagnosis and
• provide immediate and continuing care. [2023]
1.3.24 Offer children and young people with type 2 diabetes:
• advice and support on dietary management (see recommendations 1.3.15 to
1.3.22)
• a metformin monotherapy formulation in line with their own preferences
• equipment for capillary blood glucose monitoring.
See also recommendation 1.3.84 on screening for diabetic retinopathy.
In May 2023, the use of formulations other than standard-release metforminwas off-label. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines. (2015,
updated 2023) 
1.3.25 In addition, offer children and young people with type 2 diabetes:
• insulin if their HbA1c level is 69 mmol/mol (8.5%) or more
• basal-bolus insulin if they have ketosis but not diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
If the child or young person with type 2 diabetes exhibits signs and
symptoms of DKA, see section 1.4 on DKA. [2023]
Monitoring blood glucose levels and reviewing treatment
1.3.26 Four weeks after diagnosing type 2 diabetes and starting metformin in a child or
young person, review data from glucose monitoring and, if needed, change
treatment (see recommendations on adding liraglutide, dulaglutide, or
empagliflozin for people on metformin only or for people on metformin and
insulin). [2023]
1.3.27 Review treatment for children and young people with type 2 diabetes, as needed,
at least every 3 months. Assess glucose trends using available data from glucose
monitoring and HbA1c measurements. [2023]
1.3.28 If HbA1c monitoring cannot be used because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or
abnormal haemoglobin type, estimate trends in blood glucose levels using one of
the following:
• glucose profiles
• total glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)
• fructosamine estimation. [2023]
1.3.29 Adjust the frequency of capillary blood glucose monitoring based on the person's
treatment and whether they are using CGM. Ensure they have enough test strips
for capillary blood glucose monitoring. [2023] 

HbA1c targets and monitoring
1.3.30 Measure HbA1c using methods that have been calibrated according to the
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry standardisation. [2015]
1.3.31 Explain to children and young people with type 2 diabetes and their families or
carers that an HbA1c target level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) or lower will minimise
their risk of long-term complications. [2015]
1.3.32 Explain to children and young people with type 2 diabetes who have an HbA1c
level above 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) that any reduction in HbA1c level reduces their
risk of long-term complications. [2015]
1.3.33 Explain the benefits of safely achieving and maintaining the lowest attainable
HbA1c to children and young people with type 2 diabetes and their families or
carers. [2015]
1.3.34 Agree an individualised lowest achievable HbA1c target with each child or young
person with type 2 diabetes and their families or carers. Take into account factors
such as their daily activities, individual life goals, complications and
comorbidities. [2015]
1.3.35 Measure HbA1c levels every 3 months in children and young people with
type 2 diabetes. [2015]
1.3.36 Support children and young people with type 2 diabetes and their families or
carers to safely achieve and maintain their individual agreed HbA1c target level.
[2015] 
1.3.37 Diabetes services should document the proportion of children and young people
with type 2 diabetes who achieve an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7%) or lower.
[2015] 
Continuous glucose monitoring
1.3.38 Offer real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) to children and young
people with type 2 diabetes if any of the following apply. They:
• have a need, condition or disability (including a mental health need, learning
disability or cognitive impairment) that means they cannot engage in
monitoring their glucose levels by capillary blood glucose monitoring
• would otherwise be advised to self-monitor at least 8 times a day
• have recurrent or severe hypoglycaemia. [2023]
1.3.39 Consider rtCGM for children and young people with type 2 diabetes who are on
insulin therapy. [2023]
1.3.40 Consider intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM,
commonly referred to as 'flash') for children and young people with type 2
diabetes aged 4 years and over who are on insulin therapy if:
• rtCGM is contraindicated for them or
• they express a clear preference for isCGM. 
In May 2023, use of isCGM for children aged 3 years and under was offlicence. [2023]
1.3.41 When offering CGM to children and young people with type 2 diabetes, choose
the appropriate device with them, based on their individual preferences, needs,
characteristics, and the functionality of the devices available. See box 1 for
factors to consider as part of this discussion. [2023]
1.3.42 When choosing a CGM device, if multiple devices meet the person's needs and
preferences, offer the device with the lowest cost. [2023] 
1.3.43 CGM should be provided by a team with expertise in its use to support children
and young people to self-manage their type 2 diabetes. [2023]
1.3.44 Advise children and young people with type 2 diabetes who are using CGM, and
their families or carers, that they will still need to take capillary blood glucose
measurements, but they can do this less often. Explain that this is because they
will need the capillary blood glucose measurements:
• to check the accuracy of their CGM device
• as a back-up (for example, if the device stops working). [2023]
1.3.45 Monitor and review the child or young person's use of CGM when reviewing their
diabetes care plan and explain to them the importance of continuously wearing
the device. [2023]
1.3.46 If the child or young person is not using their CGM device at least 70% of the
time:
• ask if they are having problems with their device
• look at ways to address any problems or concerns to improve their use of the
device, including further education and emotional and psychological support.
[2023]
1.3.47 Commissioners, providers and healthcare professionals should address
inequalities in CGM access and uptake by: 
• monitoring who is using CGM
• identifying groups who are eligible but have a lower uptake
• making plans to engage with these groups to encourage them to consider
CGM. [2023]
