Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be
inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions
about their care, as described in making decisions about your care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about
prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.
1.1 Individualised care
1.1.1 Adopt an individualised approach to diabetes care that is tailored to the needs
and circumstances of adults with type 2 diabetes, taking into account their
personal preferences, comorbidities and risks from polypharmacy, and their
likelihood of benefiting from long-term interventions. Such an approach is
especially important in the context of multimorbidity. [2015, amended 2022]
1.1.2 Reassess the person's needs and circumstances at each review and think about
whether to stop any medicines that are not effective. [2015]
1.1.3 Take into account any disabilities, including visual impairment, when planning and
delivering care for adults with type 2 diabetes. [2015]
1.2 Education
1.2.1 Offer structured education to adults with type 2 diabetes and their family
members or carers (as appropriate) at the time of diagnosis, with annual
reinforcement and review. Explain to people that structured education is an
integral part of diabetes care. [2009]
1.2.2 Ensure that any structured education programme for adults with type 2 diabetes:
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 5 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
• is evidence-based, and suits the needs of the person
• has specific aims and learning objectives, and supports the person and their
family members and carers to develop attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and skills
to self-manage diabetes
• has a structured curriculum that is theory driven, evidence-based and
resource-effective, has supporting materials and is written down
• is delivered by trained educators who:
－ have an understanding of educational theory appropriate to the age and
needs of the person
－ are trained and competent to deliver the principles and content of the
programme
• is quality assured, and reviewed by trained, competent, independent
assessors who measure it against criteria that ensure consistency
• has outcomes that are audited regularly. [2015]
1.2.3 Ensure that education programmes for adults with type 2 diabetes provide the
necessary resources to support the educators, and that educators are properly
trained and given time to develop and maintain their skills. [2009]
1.2.4 Offer adults with type 2 diabetes group education programmes as the preferred
option. Provide an alternative of equal standard for people who are unable or
prefer not to take part in group education. [2009]
1.2.5 Ensure that education programmes for adults with type 2 diabetes meet the
cultural, linguistic, cognitive and literacy needs of people in the local area. [2009]
1.2.6 Ensure that all members of the diabetes healthcare team are familiar with the
education programmes available locally for adults with type 2 diabetes, and that
these programmes are integrated with the rest of the care pathway. [2009]
1.2.7 Ensure that adults with type 2 diabetes and their family members and carers (as
appropriate) have the opportunity to contribute to the design and provision of
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 6 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
local education programmes for adults with type 2 diabetes. [2009]
1.3 Dietary advice and bariatric surgery
1.3.1 Provide individualised and ongoing nutritional advice from a healthcare
professional with specific expertise and competencies in nutrition. [2009]
1.3.2 Provide dietary advice in a form sensitive to the person's needs, culture and
beliefs, being sensitive to their willingness to change and the effects on their
quality of life. [2009]
1.3.3 Encourage adults with type 2 diabetes to follow the same healthy eating advice
as the general population, which includes:
• eating high-fibre, low-glycaemic-index sources of carbohydrate, such as
fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and pulses
• choosing low-fat dairy products
• eating oily fish
• controlling their intake of saturated and trans fatty acids. [2009]
1.3.4 Integrate dietary advice with a personalised diabetes management plan, including
other aspects of lifestyle modification such as increasing physical activity and
losing weight. [2009]
1.3.5 For adults with type 2 diabetes who are overweight, discuss and agree an initial
body weight loss target of 5% to 10%. Remember that a small amount of weight
loss may still be beneficial, and a larger amount will have advantageous metabolic
impact in the long term. [2009]
1.3.6 Individualise recommendations for carbohydrate and alcohol intake, and meal
patterns. Make reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia a particular aim for people
using insulin or an insulin secretagogue. [2009]
1.3.7 Advise adults with type 2 diabetes that they can substitute a limited amount of

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
sucrose-containing foods for other carbohydrate in the meal plan but should take
care to avoid excess energy intake. [2009]
1.3.8 Discourage adults with type 2 diabetes from using foods marketed specifically for
people with diabetes. [2009]
1.3.9 When adults with type 2 diabetes are admitted as inpatients to hospital or any
other care setting, implement a meal planning system that provides consistency
in the carbohydrate content of meals and snacks. [2009]
1.3.10 For recommendations on lifestyle advice, see the NICE guidelines on overweight
and obesity management, physical activity and tobacco. [2015]
1.3.11 For recommendations on bariatric surgery for people with recent-onset type 2
diabetes, see the section on bariatric surgery for people with recent-onset type 2
diabetes in the NICE guideline on overweight and obesity management. [2015]
1.4 Diagnosing and managing hypertension
The recommendations on diagnosing and managing hypertension have been removed. For
recommendations on hypertension in people with type 2 diabetes, see the NICE guideline
on hypertension in adults. Diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of hypertension is broadly
the same for people with type 2 diabetes as for other people. When a different approach is
needed for people with type 2 diabetes, this is specified in the hypertension guideline.
1.5 Antiplatelet therapy
1.5.1 Do not offer antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) to adults with type 2
diabetes without cardiovascular disease. [2015]
1.5.2 For guidance on the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease
in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NICE guidelines on cardiovascular disease
and acute coronary syndromes. [2015]

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
1.6 Blood glucose management
HbA1c measurement and targets
Measurement
1.6.1 Measure HbA1c levels in adults with type 2 diabetes every:
• 3 to 6 months (tailored to individual needs) until HbA1c is stable on
unchanging therapy
• 6 months once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are
stable. [2015]
1.6.2 Measure HbA1c using methods calibrated according to International Federation of
Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardisation. [2015]
1.6.3 If HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or
abnormal haemoglobin type, estimate trends in blood glucose control using one
of the following:
• quality-controlled plasma glucose profiles
• total glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)
• fructosamine estimation. [2015]
1.6.4 Investigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose
measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes or
clinical biochemistry. [2015]
Targets
NICE has produced a patient decision aid on agreeing HbA1c targets, which also covers
factors to weigh up when discussing HbA1c targets with patients.
1.6.5 Discuss and agree an individual HbA1c target with adults with type 2 diabetes
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 9 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
(see recommendations 1.6.6 to 1.6.10). Encourage them to reach their target and
maintain it, unless any resulting adverse effects (including hypoglycaemia), or
their efforts to achieve their target impair their quality of life. Think about using
the NICE patient decision aid on weighing up HbA1c targets to support these
discussions. [2015, amended 2022]
1.6.6 Offer lifestyle advice and drug treatment to support adults with type 2 diabetes
to reach and maintain their HbA1c target (see the sections on dietary advice and
bariatric surgery and choosing drug treatments). For more information about
supporting adherence, see the NICE guideline on medicines adherence. [2015]
1.6.7 For adults whose type 2 diabetes is managed either by lifestyle and diet, or
lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia,
support them to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%). For adults on a
drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support them to aim for an HbA1c level of
53 mmol/mol (7.0%). [2015]
1.6.8 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a
single drug and rise to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) or higher:
• reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment and
• support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and
• intensify drug treatment. [2015]
1.6.9 Consider relaxing the target HbA1c level (see recommendations 1.6.7 and 1.6.8
and NICE's patient decision aid) on a case-by-case basis and in discussion with
adults with type 2 diabetes, with particular consideration for people who are
older or frailer, if:
• they are unlikely to achieve longer-term risk-reduction benefits, for example,
people with a reduced life expectancy
• tight blood glucose control would put them at high risk if they developed
hypoglycaemia, for example, if they are at risk of falling, they have impaired
awareness of hypoglycaemia, or they drive or operate machinery as part of
their job

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
• intensive management would not be appropriate, for example if they have
significant comorbidities. [2015, amended 2022]
1.6.10 If adults with type 2 diabetes reach an HbA1c level that is lower than their target
and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it. Be
aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example
deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss. [2015]
1.6.11 For guidance on HbA1c targets for women with type 2 diabetes who are pregnant
or planning to become pregnant, see the NICE guideline on diabetes in
pregnancy. [2015]
Self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose
These recommendations relate to self-monitoring by capillary blood glucose monitoring.
1.6.12 Take the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)'s Assessing fitness to drive:
a guide for medical professionals into account when offering self-monitoring of
capillary blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes. [2015, amended
2022]
1.6.13 Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels for adults
with type 2 diabetes unless:
• the person is on insulin or
• there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or
• the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of
hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or
• the person is pregnant or is planning to become pregnant (see the NICE
guideline on diabetes in pregnancy). [2015, amended 2022]
1.6.14 Consider short-term self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose levels in adults
with type 2 diabetes, reviewing treatment as necessary:
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 11 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
• when starting treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids or
• to confirm suspected hypoglycaemia. [2015, amended 2022]
1.6.15 Be aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who have acute intercurrent illness are
at risk of worsening hyperglycaemia. Review treatment as necessary. [2015]
1.6.16 If adults with type 2 diabetes are self-monitoring their capillary blood glucose
levels, carry out a structured assessment at least annually. The assessment
should include:
• the person's self-monitoring skills
• the quality and frequency of testing
• checking that the person knows how to interpret the blood glucose results
and what action to take
• the impact on the person's quality of life
• the continued benefit to the person
• the equipment used. [2015, amended 2022]
Continuous glucose monitoring
1.6.17 Offer intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM, commonly
referred to as 'flash') to adults with type 2 diabetes on multiple daily insulin
injections if any of the following apply:
• they have recurrent hypoglycaemia or severe hypoglycaemia
• they have impaired hypoglycaemia awareness
• they have a condition or disability (including a learning disability or cognitive
impairment) that means they cannot self-monitor their blood glucose by
capillary blood glucose monitoring but could use an isCGM device (or have it
scanned for them)

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
• they would otherwise be advised to self-measure at least 8 times a day.
For guidance on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for pregnant women,
see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy. [2022]
1.6.18 Offer isCGM to adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes who would otherwise
need help from a care worker or healthcare professional to monitor their blood
glucose. [2022]
1.6.19 Consider real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) as an alternative to
isCGM for adults with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes if it is available for the same
or lower cost. [2022]
1.6.20 CGM should be provided by a team with expertise in its use, as part of supporting
people to self-manage their diabetes. [2022]
1.6.21 Advise adults with type 2 diabetes who are using CGM that they will still need to
take capillary blood glucose measurements (although they can do this less often).
Explain that is because:
• they will need to use capillary blood glucose measurements to check the
accuracy of their CGM device
• they will need capillary blood glucose monitoring as a back-up (for example
when their blood glucose levels are changing quickly or if the device stops
working).
Provide them with enough test strips to take capillary blood glucose
measurements as needed. [2022]
1.6.22 If a person is offered rtCGM or isCGM but cannot or does not want to use any of
these devices, offer capillary blood glucose monitoring. [2022]
1.6.23 Ensure CGM is part of the education provided to adults with type 2 diabetes who
are using it (see the section on education). [2022]
1.6.24 Monitor and review the person's use of CGM as part of reviewing their diabetes
care plan (see the section on individualised care). [2022]

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
1.6.25 If there are concerns about the way a person is using the CGM device:
• ask if they are having problems using their device
• look at ways to address any problems and concerns to improve their use of
the device, including further education and emotional and psychological
support. [2022]
1.6.26 Commissioners, providers and healthcare professionals should address
inequalities in CGM access and uptake by:
• monitoring who is using CGM
• identifying groups who are eligible but who have a lower uptake
• making plans to engage with these groups to encourage them to consider
CGM. [2022]
For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations see the
rationale and impact section on continuous glucose monitoring.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C:
continuous glucose monitoring in adults with type 2 diabetes.
1.7 Drug treatment
Recommendations in this section that cover dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors,
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics, sulfonylureas and sodium–glucose
cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors refer to each of these groups of drugs at class level
unless otherwise stated.
NICE technology appraisals for SGLT2 inhibitors recommend the use of these medicines
only in specific populations and in certain circumstances. The 2022 update of this
guideline looked at the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence for SGLT2 inhibitors in
people with cardiovascular disease or at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
The guideline recommends SGLT2 inhibitors in a wider population than the technology
appraisals that were published before February 2022.

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
Choosing drug treatments
We have produced a visual summary to provide an overview of the recommendations and
additional information to support medicines choice.
1.7.1 Discuss with adults with type 2 diabetes the benefits and risks of drug treatment
and the options available. Base the choice of drug treatments on:
• the person's individual clinical circumstances, for example comorbidities,
contraindications, weight, and risks from polypharmacy
• the person's individual preferences and needs
• the effectiveness of the drug treatments in terms of metabolic response and
cardiovascular and renal protection
• safety and tolerability of the drug treatment
• monitoring requirements
• the licensed indications or combinations available
• cost (if 2 drugs in the same class are appropriate, choose the option with the
lowest acquisition cost). [2015, amended 2022]
See the NICE guideline on shared decision making and the section on safety
of medicines for diabetes before and during pregnancy in the NICE guideline
on diabetes in pregnancy.
Rescue therapy at any phase of treatment
1.7.2 If an adult with type 2 diabetes is symptomatically hyperglycaemic, consider
insulin (see the section on insulin-based treatments) or a sulfonylurea, and review
treatment when blood glucose control has been achieved. [2015]
First-line drug treatment
Also see the visual summary on first-line drug treatment for an overview of the
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 15 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
recommendations and additional information to support medicines choice.
For adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, follow recommendations on
SGLT2 inhibitors in the section on chronic kidney disease in this guideline.
1.7.3 Offer standard-release metformin as first-line drug treatment to adults with
type 2 diabetes. [2015]
1.7.4 Assess the person's cardiovascular status and risk to determine whether they
have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or
are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
See the recommendations on using risk scores and QRISK2 to assess
cardiovascular disease risk in adults with type 2 diabetes in NICE's guideline on
cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid
modification. [2022]
1.7.5 Based on the cardiovascular risk assessment for the person with type 2 diabetes:
• If they have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease, offer an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular
benefit in addition to metformin.
• If they are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, consider an
SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit in addition to metformin.
[2022]
See the rationale and impact section on first-line drug treatment for an explanation of
'proven cardiovascular benefit'.
1.7.6 When starting an adult with type 2 diabetes on dual therapy with metformin and
an SGLT2 inhibitor as first-line therapy, introduce the drugs sequentially, starting
with metformin and checking tolerability. Start the SGLT2 inhibitor as soon as
metformin tolerability is confirmed. [2022]
1.7.7 Gradually increase the dose of standard-release metformin over several weeks to
minimise the risk of gastrointestinal side effects in adults with type 2 diabetes.
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 16 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
[2015]
1.7.8 If an adult with type 2 diabetes experiences gastrointestinal side effects with
standard-release metformin, consider a trial of modified-release metformin.
[2015]
1.7.9 For first-line drug treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is
contraindicated or not tolerated:
• If they have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease, offer an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular
benefit.
• If they are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, consider an
SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit. [2022]
1.7.10 For first-line drug treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is
contraindicated or not tolerated and if they are not in either of the groups in
recommendation 1.7.9, consider:
• a DPP-4 inhibitor or
• pioglitazone or
• a sulfonylurea or
• an SGLT2 inhibitor for people who meet the criteria in NICE's technology
appraisal guidance on canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin as
monotherapies or ertugliflozin as monotherapy or with metformin for treating
type 2 diabetes. [2015, amended 2022]
1.7.11 Before starting an SGLT2 inhibitor, check whether the person may be at
increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), for example if:
• they have had a previous episode of DKA
• they are unwell with intercurrent illness
• they are following a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet. [2022]
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 17 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
1.7.12 Address modifiable risks for DKA before starting an SGLT2 inhibitor. For example,
for people who are following a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet, they may
need to delay treatment until they have changed their diet. [2022]
1.7.13 Advise adults with type 2 diabetes who are taking an SGLT2 inhibitor about the
need to minimise their risk of DKA by not starting a very low carbohydrate or
ketogenic diet without discussing it with their healthcare professional, because
they may need to suspend SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. [2022]
For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how
they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on first-line drug
treatment.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's decision are in evidence review B:
pharmacological therapies with cardiovascular and other benefits in people with
type 2 diabetes.
Reviewing drug treatments
1.7.14 When reviewing or considering changing treatments for adults with type 2
diabetes, think about and discuss the following with the person:
• how to optimise their current treatment regimen before thinking about
changing treatments, taking into account factors such as:
－ adverse effects
－ adherence to existing medicines
－ the need to revisit advice about diet and lifestyle
－ prescribed doses and formulations
• stopping medicines that have had no impact on glycaemic control or weight,
unless there is an additional clinical benefit, such as cardiovascular or renal
protection, from continued treatment (see the note below on off-label use)
• whether switching rather than adding drugs could be effective
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 18 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
• the considerations about treatment choice in recommendation 1.7.1. [2022]
In February 2022, using ertugliflozin to reduce cardiovascular risk when
blood glucose is well controlled was off-label. See NICE's information on
prescribing medicines.
Also see the recommendations on medication review in the NICE guideline on
medicines optimisation and on reviewing medicines and supporting
adherence in the NICE guideline on medicines adherence.
1.7.15 For adults with type 2 diabetes who start taking an SGLT2 inhibitor before they
are 40 because they have an elevated lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease, do
not stop the SGLT2 inhibitor when they turn 40 even if their QRISK2 score is
below 10%. Only stop the SGLT2 inhibitor if the person's circumstances have
changed and the SGLT2 inhibitor is no longer appropriate. [2022]
Adding an SGLT2 inhibitor at any stage after first-line treatment has been
started
1.7.16 For adults with type 2 diabetes at any stage after they have started first-line
treatment:
• If they have or develop chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease, offer an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular
benefit in addition to current treatment or replace an existing drug with the
SGLT2 inhibitor.
• If they are or become at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease,
consider adding an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit to
current treatment or replacing an existing drug with the SGLT2 inhibitor.
Take into account the person's current treatment regimen and preferences
and make a shared decision about switching treatments or adding an SGLT2
inhibitor, as appropriate (also see recommendations 1.7.12 and 1.7.13 on
starting an SGLT2 inhibitor). [2022]

an overview of the recommendations and additional information to support medicines
choice.
1.7.17 Introduce drugs used in combination therapy in a stepwise manner, checking for
tolerability and effectiveness of each drug. [2015]
1.7.18 For adults with type 2 diabetes, if monotherapy has not continued to control
HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for further
intervention, consider adding:
• a DPP-4 inhibitor or
• pioglitazone or
• a sulfonylurea or
• an SGLT2 inhibitor for people who meet the criteria in NICE's technology
appraisal guidance on canagliflozin in combination therapy, ertugliflozin as
monotherapy or with metformin, or dapagliflozin or empagliflozin in
combination therapy. [2015, amended 2022]

drug has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually
agreed threshold for further intervention consider either:
• triple therapy by adding a DPP-4 inhibitor, pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea or an
SGLT2 inhibitor for people who meet the criteria in NICE's technology
appraisal guidance on canagliflozin in combination therapy, dapagliflozin in
triple therapy, empagliflozin in combination therapy, or ertugliflozin with
metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor or
• starting insulin-based treatment (see the section on insulin-based
treatments). [2015, amended 2022]
1.7.20 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated and
dual therapy with 2 oral drugs has not continued to control HbA1c to below the
person's individually agreed threshold for intervention, consider insulin-based
treatment (see the section on insulin-based treatments). [2015, amended 2022]
1.7.21 If triple therapy with metformin and 2 other oral drugs is not effective, not
tolerated or contraindicated, consider triple therapy by switching one drug for a
GLP-1 mimetic for adults with type 2 diabetes who:
• have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m2 or higher (adjust accordingly for
people from Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups) and specific
psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity or
• have a BMI lower than 35 kg/m2 and:
－ for whom insulin therapy would have significant occupational implications
or
－ weight loss would benefit other significant obesity-related comorbidities.
[2015, amended 2022]
1.7.22 Only continue GLP-1 mimetic therapy if the adult with type 2 diabetes has had a
beneficial metabolic response (a reduction of at least 11 mmol/mol [1.0%] in
HbA1c and weight loss of at least 3% of initial body weight in 6 months). [2015]
1.7.23 For adults with type 2 diabetes, only offer combination therapy with a GLP-1
mimetic and insulin along with specialist care advice and ongoing support from a

Insulin-based treatments
1.7.24 For adults with type 2 diabetes starting insulin therapy, provide a structured
programme using active insulin dose titration that encompasses:
• injection technique, including rotating injection sites and avoiding repeated
injections at the same point within sites
• continuing telephone support
• self-monitoring
• dose titration to target levels
• dietary advice
• the DVLA's Assessing fitness to drive: a guide for medical professionals
• managing hypoglycaemia
• managing acute changes in plasma glucose control
• support from an appropriately trained and experienced healthcare
professional. [2015]
1.7.25 For adults with type 2 diabetes starting insulin therapy, continue to offer
metformin for people without contraindications or intolerance. Review the
continued need for other blood glucose lowering therapies. [2015]

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
1.7.26 Start insulin therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes from a choice of the following
insulin types and regimens:
• Offer neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin injected once or twice daily
according to need.
• Consider starting both NPH and short-acting insulin (particularly if the
person's HbA1c is 75 mmol/mol [9.0%] or higher), administered either:
－ separately or
－ as a pre-mixed (biphasic) human insulin preparation.
• Consider, as an alternative to NPH insulin, using insulin detemir or insulin
glargine if:
－ the person needs help from a carer or healthcare professional to inject
insulin, and use of insulin detemir or insulin glargine would reduce the
frequency of injections from twice to once daily or
－ the person's lifestyle is restricted by recurrent symptomatic
hypoglycaemic episodes or
－ the person would otherwise need twice-daily NPH insulin injections in
combination with oral glucose-lowering drugs.
• Consider pre-mixed (biphasic) preparations that include short-acting insulin
analogues, rather than pre-mixed (biphasic) preparations that include
short-acting human insulin preparations, if:
－ the person prefers injecting insulin immediately before a meal or
－ hypoglycaemia is a problem or
－ blood glucose levels rise markedly after meals. [2015]
1.7.27 Consider switching to insulin detemir or insulin glargine from NPH insulin in adults
with type 2 diabetes:
• who do not reach their target HbA1c because of significant hypoglycaemia or
• who experience significant hypoglycaemia on NPH insulin irrespective of the

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
level of HbA1c reached or
• who cannot use the device needed to inject NPH insulin but could administer
their own insulin safely and accurately if a switch to one of the long-acting
insulin analogues was made or
• who need help from a carer or healthcare professional to administer insulin
injections and for whom switching to one of the long-acting insulin analogues
would reduce the number of daily injections. [2015]
1.7.28 Monitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on a basal insulin regimen (NPH
insulin, insulin detemir or insulin glargine) for the need for short-acting insulin
before meals (or a pre-mixed [biphasic] insulin preparation). [2015]
1.7.29 Monitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on pre-mixed (biphasic) insulin for
the need for a further injection of short-acting insulin before meals or for a
change to a basal-bolus regimen with NPH insulin or insulin detemir or insulin
glargine, if blood glucose control remains inadequate. [2015]
1.7.30 When starting an insulin for which a biosimilar is available, use the product with
the lowest acquisition cost. [2021]
1.7.31 Ensure the risk of medication errors with insulins is minimised by following the
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance on
minimising the risk of medication error with high strength, fixed combination and
biosimilar insulin products, which includes advice for healthcare professionals
when starting treatment with a biosimilar. [2021]
1.7.32 When people are already using an insulin for which a lower cost biosimilar is
available, discuss the possibility of switching to the biosimilar. Make a shared
decision with the person after discussing their preferences. [2021]

1.8 Managing complications
Periodontitis
1.8.1 Advise adults with type 2 diabetes at their annual review that:
• they are at higher risk of periodontitis
• if they get periodontitis, managing it can improve their blood glucose control
and can reduce their risk of hyperglycaemia. [2022]
1.8.2 Advise adults with type 2 diabetes to have regular oral health reviews (their oral
healthcare or dental team will tell them how often, in line with the NICE guideline
on dental checks: intervals between oral health reviews). [2022]
1.8.3 For guidance for oral healthcare and dental teams on how to provide oral health
advice, see the NICE guideline on oral health promotion. [2022]

Gastroparesis
1.8.5 Think about a diagnosis of gastroparesis in adults with type 2 diabetes who have
erratic blood glucose control or unexplained gastric bloating or vomiting, taking
into account possible alternative diagnoses. [2009, amended 2015]
1.8.6 For adults with type 2 diabetes who have vomiting caused by gastroparesis,
explain that:
• there is no strong evidence that any available antiemetic therapy is effective
• some people have had benefit with domperidone, erythromycin or
metoclopramide
• the strongest evidence for effectiveness is for domperidone, but prescribers
must take into account its safety profile, in particular its cardiac risk and
potential interactions with other medicines. [2015]
In December 2015, the use of erythromycin was off-label. See NICE's
information on prescribing medicines.
1.8.7 To treat vomiting caused by gastroparesis in adults with type 2 diabetes:
• consider alternating the use of erythromycin and metoclopramide
• consider domperidone only in exceptional circumstances (if domperidone is
the only effective treatment) and in accordance with MHRA guidance on
domperidone. [2015]
In December 2015, the use of erythromycin was off-label. See NICE's
information on prescribing medicines.

in adults with type 2 diabetes who lose the warning signs of hypoglycaemia.
[2009, amended 2015]
1.8.11 Think about the possibility of autonomic neuropathy affecting the gut in adults
with type 2 diabetes who have unexplained diarrhoea that happens particularly at
night. [2009, amended 2015]
1.8.12 For adults with type 2 diabetes and autonomic neuropathy who are taking
tricyclic drugs and antihypertensive drug treatments, be aware of the increased
likelihood of side effects such as orthostatic hypotension. For guidance on safe
prescribing of antidepressants (such as tricyclic drugs) and managing withdrawal,
see NICE's guideline on medicines associated with dependence or withdrawal
symptoms. [2009]
1.8.13 For adults with type 2 diabetes who have unexplained bladder-emptying
problems, investigate the possibility of autonomic neuropathy affecting the
bladder. [2009]
1.8.14 In managing autonomic neuropathy symptoms, include specific interventions
indicated by the manifestations (for example, for abnormal sweating or nocturnal
diarrhoea). [2009]

diabetes, see the NICE guideline on diabetic foot problems. [2015]
Chronic kidney disease
1.8.16 For adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes, offer an
angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor (titrated to the highest licensed dose that the person can tolerate) if
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is 3 mg/mmol or more, as recommended in the
section on pharmacotherapy for CKD in adults, children, and young people with
related persistent proteinuria in the NICE guideline on chronic kidney disease.
[2021]
1.8.17 For adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD who are taking an ARB or an ACE
inhibitor (titrated to the highest licensed dose that they can tolerate), offer an
SGLT2 inhibitor (in addition to the ARB or ACE inhibitor) if:
• ACR is over 30 mg/mmol and
• they meet the criteria in the marketing authorisation (including relevant
estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] thresholds).
In November 2021, not all SGLT2 inhibitors were licensed for this indication.
See NICE's information on prescribing medicines. [2021]
1.8.18 For adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD who are taking an ARB or an ACE
inhibitor (titrated to the highest licensed dose that they can tolerate), consider an
SGLT2 inhibitor (in addition to the ARB or ACE inhibitor) if:

part of their annual review. [2015]
1.8.22 Assess, educate and support men with type 2 diabetes who have problematic
erectile dysfunction, addressing contributory factors such as cardiovascular
disease as well as possible treatment options. [2015]
1.8.23 Consider a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor to treat problematic erectile
dysfunction in men with type 2 diabetes. Initially choose the drug with the lowest
acquisition cost and take into account any contraindications. [2015]
1.8.24 After discussion, refer men with type 2 diabetes to a service offering other
medical, surgical or psychological management of erectile dysfunction if
treatment (including a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, as appropriate) has been
unsuccessful. [2015]

Recommendations for research
The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research.
Key recommendations for research
1 The effects of stopping or switching drug treatments to control
blood glucose levels
In adults with type 2 diabetes, what are the effects of stopping and/or switching drug
treatments to control blood glucose levels, and what criteria should inform the decision?
[2015]
Why this is important
There is a lack of evidence on the effects of stopping and/or switching drug treatments to
control blood glucose levels. The current practice of 'stopping rules' is typically motivated
by either inadequate blood glucose control (rising HbA1c levels) or intolerable side effects.
There is limited understanding of the short- and long-term effects of stopping a therapy
and switching to another in terms of diabetes control (HbA1c levels), hypoglycaemic risk,
weight gain, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, there is limited
understanding of how quickly consideration should be given to stopping and switching to
another drug treatment and, if stopping and switching may be needed, what the optimal
sequencing is of drug treatments. Randomised controlled trials examining these different
issues would help to improve diabetes care.
2 Non-metformin-based drug treatment combinations to control
blood glucose levels
In adults with type 2 diabetes, what treatment combinations (for example, glucagon-like
peptide-1 [GLP-1] mimetics and insulin combination therapy with meglitinides) are most
effective when initial drug treatment with non-metformin monotherapy fails to adequately
control blood glucose levels? [2015]
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 33 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
Why this is important
Although it is recognised that metformin therapy is suitable for most adults with type 2
diabetes, its use is contraindicated or not tolerated in approximately 15% of individuals. To
date, research evidence has largely focused on metformin-based treatment combinations.
Given the progressive nature of the condition, in which intensification of blood glucose
lowering drug therapies are indicated over time, there is little evidence, for some adults, to
guide management strategies on treatment combinations that do not include metformin.
Randomised controlled trials are therefore needed to better understand the treatment
choices that are available which improve blood glucose control and long-term risks of
complications associated with diabetes.
3 Drug treatment for when blood glucose levels are inadequately
controlled by 3 oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin combinations
When blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled by 3 oral antidiabetic drugs and/or
insulin combinations, which blood glucose lowering therapies should be used to control
blood glucose levels? [2015, amended 2021]
Why this is important
As the incidence of type 2 diabetes increases in the younger population and as blood
glucose control declines naturally over time, it is likely that further intensification of
therapies would be needed. Currently, there is evidence up to second intensification of
drug therapies, that is, when 2 or more non-insulin-based treatment combinations fail to
adequately control blood glucose levels. Randomised controlled trials are needed to
improve understanding of alternative treatment options for adults at second intensification
whose blood glucose is inadequately controlled with insulin and/or triple non-insulin-based
drug therapies.
4 Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels
What is the optimal frequency for self-monitoring of blood glucose in adults with type 2
diabetes? [2015]
Why this is important
There is limited evidence in relation to the long-term effects (at least 5 years) of blood

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58

glucose lowering therapies, particularly newer agents in terms of efficacy and adverse
events (for example, cardiovascular outcomes). Randomised controlled trials and
prospective longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the long-term efficacy
and safety issues surrounding these medicines.

Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
Rationale and impact
These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how
they might affect practice.
Continuous glucose monitoring
Recommendations 1.6.17 to 1.6.26
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee discussed how continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) could potentially be
useful for many people with type 2 diabetes. They were aware of examples from current
practice in which adults who have insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and use intermittently
scanned CGM (isCGM) have had good outcomes. Because of the additional cost
associated with CGM and the large number of adults with type 2 diabetes, the committee
used both the evidence and their clinical experience to decide who would gain the most
benefit from using CGM.
There was evidence that intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) was cost effective for
adults with type 2 diabetes using insulin, but no evidence for populations not using insulin,
so the committee agreed to restrict their recommendations to that subpopulation.
People who have recurrent or severe hypoglycaemic events were identified as one of the
groups likely to benefit most from isCGM, because hypoglycaemic events were considered
to be one of the most important and concerning outcomes for adults with type 2 diabetes
who are using insulin. The committee decided that the number of hypoglycaemic events
was a more effective indicator of someone who would benefit from isCGM than specific
HbA1c target values, because target values can vary between people. The evidence also
indicated minimal effects of isCGM on HbA1c values.
The committee agreed that people with impaired hypoglycaemic awareness would also
benefit from isCGM. However, they did not recommend specific methods for assessing
impaired hypoglycaemic awareness. This is because validated methods for assessing
impaired hypoglycaemic awareness in people with type 2 diabetes (such as the GOLD or
Clarke scores) are not always available in primary care.

Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
People who use insulin and have a condition or disability that restricts their ability to self-
monitor blood glucose levels should also be offered isCGM. This is because having access
to isGCM means they will no longer have to rely on others to monitor their diabetes,
potentially increasing their independence. For people with learning disabilities, this
recommendation is in line with similar guidance for type 1 diabetes set out in the NHS
RightCare Pathway, which specifies reasonable adjustments for people with a learning
disability who have diabetes.
People who are advised to self-measure using capillary blood glucose monitoring more
than 8 times a day should also be offered isCGM. This is in line with the funding
requirements for NHS England's flash glucose monitoring: national arrangements for
funding of relevant diabetes patients. Although the funding requirements are specifically
for people with type 1 diabetes, the committee thought that this criterion was also
important for people with type 2 diabetes who have to monitor their blood glucose levels
multiple times a day.
People who need help from a care worker or other healthcare professional to administer
their insulin injections should also be offered isCGM, even if they only use once-daily
insulin injections. isCGM will help care workers to record a person's blood glucose levels
quickly. And for people who have multiple home care visits per day, blood glucose levels
can be recorded at each visit. This will help them to adjust their insulin levels to reduce the
risk of hypoglycaemic events between home visits. It may also reduce the number of
hospital admissions for this group.
The committee discussed how short-term use of isCGM may still be useful for some
people. It may help people to understand when they have hypoglycaemic episodes, which
would help them to develop a more effective treatment plan.
There was no evidence that real-time CGM (rtCGM) was cost effective for people with
type 2 diabetes, so the committee agreed it could not be recommended for all adults with
type 2 diabetes (whether or not they used insulin). They noted, however, that prices of
rtCGM have reduced over the past few years, and if this continues to happen there may
come a time when it is no more expensive than isCGM. At this point, rtCGM would be an
appropriate alternative for people who meet the criteria for isCGM.
The committee did not make a recommendation on using specific devices because CGM
technologies are changing very quickly and this recommendation would soon be out of
date. Local healthcare services are better placed to assess which devices are evidence-

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
based and suitable for use at any given time.
The committee discussed how self-monitoring of blood glucose should still take place,
albeit less frequently, even when a person is using CGM. The ability to self-monitor blood
glucose levels allows people to ensure the accuracy of the CGM device. The committee
also recommended keeping capillary blood glucose monitoring as a back-up for situations
such as when the technology fails.
The committee decided to highlight that CGM should be provided by a team who have
expertise in its use. To ensure that CGM is effective, healthcare professionals need to have
the skills to interpret and communicate the data effectively. As well as healthcare
professionals having a clear understanding of CGM, it is also crucial that people with
type 2 diabetes who are using CGM have education about the technology. This will
increase the likelihood that people will scan and report the results frequently, allowing
people to understand and manage their diabetes effectively.
Although many people will choose CGM if offered, there are some people who either
cannot be offered it or do not want to use it. Because it is still important for these people
to monitor their blood glucose levels, the committee made a recommendation to reinforce
the importance of offering capillary blood glucose monitoring instead.
The committee did not make a recommendation on how long CGM should be used
because there was no evidence on this, and they did not want to stop people accessing
CGM for short periods if they and their healthcare professional thought they could benefit
from this. Using CGM for a short period of time may help some people to understand when
they have hypoglycaemic episodes, thereby helping them to develop a more effective
treatment plan.
Despite the positive recommendations on CGM, the committee were concerned that
existing health inequalities may still lead to lower uptake of CGM in some groups of people.
To address this, the committee made a recommendation outlining actions for
commissioners, providers and healthcare professionals.
The committee highlighted the importance of routinely reviewing a person's use of CGM.
This will establish whether it is providing clinical benefits and whether the monitor is being
used correctly. Making people aware that their use of CGM will be continually reviewed is
important so they know it is not a guaranteed long-term option.

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
The committee also made a recommendation for research on using routinely collected
real-world data to assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of CGM. They agreed
that this has the potential to show the direct effects of the technology used by people
with type 2 diabetes instead of interpreting it through the results of clinical trials.
Increased monitoring of routine healthcare data including registries and audits would
ensure that findings from a broader population are captured.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations are likely to increase the number of adults with type 2 diabetes who
are offered CGM, particularly those who have issues with hypoglycaemia. This will have
associated cost implications:
• It may save the NHS time, because healthcare professionals do not have to meet
people who are using CGM as often as people who use capillary blood glucose
monitoring.
• There should be fewer hypoglycaemic events to manage.
The committee did not expect a significant resource impact related to education and
monitoring for the CGM devices.

First-line drug treatment
Recommendations 1.7.3 to 1.7.13
Why the committee made the recommendations
Drug treatment for people without high cardiovascular risk
The evidence from the clinical trials looking at cardiovascular benefits, the network meta-
analyses, and the economic modelling, showed that some treatments were effective at
improving cardiovascular outcomes and were likely to be cost effective. All of these trials
recruited people with established cardiovascular disease, and some also included people
with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. However, for people without high
cardiovascular risk, the committee agreed there was more uncertainty over whether the
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 40 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
same level of cardiovascular benefits seen in the high-risk groups could be applied to a
lower risk population. They decided that they could not justify changing the
recommendations for people at lower risk based on this evidence. Therefore, they retained
the 2015 recommendations outlining the drug treatment options for people in the lower
risk group.
Assessing cardiovascular status
The committee agreed it was important to assess people's cardiovascular status and risk
to help determine which treatments are suitable for them. They used a definition for the
established cardiovascular disease group (adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart
failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) that reflected the people
included in all the clinical trials and modelled as a subgroup in the economic model.
To assess whether people are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, the
committee recommended using the QRISK2 tool because this is recommended in the NICE
guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid
modification for adults with type 2 diabetes, and the factors covered by this tool were
similar to those used in the trials and economic model to define this population. In
addition, this tool is widely used in current practice in the NHS.
Lifetime cardiovascular risk may be underestimated in people aged under 40 using this
tool, so the committee also included risk factors to consider for this age group. This
definition was broadly aligned to the subgroup of people with high cardiovascular risk
without established cardiovascular disease who were included in the model.
Choosing an SGLT2 inhibitor with cardiovascular benefit
The evidence showed that SGLT2 inhibitors as a class of drugs were most likely to be cost
effective in combination with metformin, although the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
(ICER) varied between different drugs in the class and in different scenarios in the model.
The exception to this was dapagliflozin, which was cost effective at a threshold of
£20,000 per quality-adjusted life year in the base-case analysis and across a range of
model scenarios. However, the committee agreed there was too much uncertainty in the
clinical data, and therefore the economic modelling, for them to be confident that these
different ICERs represented true underlying differences in cost effectiveness.
There were also varying levels of certainty in the clinical trials and the network meta-

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
analyses about:
• which individual SGLT2 inhibitors were effective at improving cardiovascular outcomes
• whether there were real differences in cardiovascular benefits between the different
SGLT2 inhibitors.
For hospitalisation for heart failure, empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin
produced a clinically meaningful reduction compared with placebo in the random
effects network meta-analysis model. However, in the sensitivity analyses using a
fixed effect model, ertugliflozin also showed a clinically meaningful reduction
compared with placebo (which reflects the original clinical trial data). The network
meta-analysis could not differentiate between the SGLT2 inhibitors.
For the 3-point MACE outcome (a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events), only
canagliflozin and empagliflozin produced a statistically significant reduction compared
with placebo. However, the network meta-analyses again could not differentiate between
SGLT2 inhibitors.
For all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, empagliflozin showed a clinically
meaningful reduction compared with placebo and the other SGLT2 inhibitors. The network
meta-analysis could not differentiate between the other SGLT2 inhibitors.
For non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke, the network meta-analysis could
not differentiate between empagliflozin, canagliflozin, ertugliflozin or placebo. The data for
dapagliflozin was reported differently and could not be included in the network meta-
analyses. In the clinical trial data, dapagliflozin could not be differentiated from placebo for
myocardial infarction and was not meaningfully different from placebo for stroke.
Finally, only dapagliflozin showed a clinically meaningful reduction in severe
hypoglycaemia compared with placebo. However, the remaining SGLT2 inhibitors could not
be differentiated from each other or from placebo in the network meta-analysis.
Taking the cost effectiveness and clinical results into account, the committee decided
against recommending only dapagliflozin and instead made recommendations for the
SGLT2 inhibitors as a class. However, they recognised that there was greater uncertainty
around the cardiovascular benefits associated with ertugliflozin than there was for
empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin. This was because ertugliflozin did not
consistently show a reduction in heart failure compared with placebo in the network meta-

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
analyses (it depended on the model used), and it was not statistically significantly better
than placebo for the 3-point MACE outcome. The committee therefore decided to refer to
'SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit' in the recommendations. This was to
enable prescribers to select a particular drug from the class of SGLT2 inhibitors that they
thought was clinically appropriate for each person, while allowing the recommendation to
remain current even if additional evidence or new SGLT2 inhibitors become available.
The committee agreed there was more certainty of cardiovascular benefits in adults with
type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease because they were participants in all the included trials, while people at high risk
of developing cardiovascular disease were included in fewer trials. So, they recommended
dual therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit in addition to
metformin for both groups, but only as an option to consider for people without
established cardiovascular disease, to reflect the lower certainty. For people without a
high risk of developing cardiovascular disease who do not have chronic heart failure or
established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, metformin monotherapy remains the
recommended first-line treatment option, based on the 2015 recommendation.
When starting first-line dual therapy, the committee noted the importance of introducing
the drugs sequentially. This enables any side effects and intolerances from the first drug
to be identified before the second drug is introduced. In line with current practice, the
committee recommended starting with metformin and then adding the SGLT2 inhibitor
without delay once metformin tolerability is established, to avoid people remaining on
metformin alone for prolonged periods.
Some people will have established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing
cardiovascular disease, but not be able to take an SGLT2 inhibitor. As GLP-1 mimetics were
not cost-effective options in this situation (see the rationale and impact section on why
GLP-1 mimetics were not recommended as first-line treatment), the committee agreed that
these people would be offered metformin alone as a first-line treatment (see
recommendation 1.7.3).
If metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated
People who cannot tolerate metformin or for whom it is contraindicated were not included
as a separate group in the economic model because the evidence was taken from trials
that did not separate results by whether the person was able to take metformin or not.
Most people in these trials were expected to be able to take metformin. The committee
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 43 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
agreed with the assumption that people who cannot tolerate metformin or for whom it is
contraindicated would be offered the next most effective and cost-effective treatment
options after metformin.
In the economic model scenario, when another drug was used in place of metformin for
people with established cardiovascular disease or at high risk of developing cardiovascular
disease, SGLT2 inhibitors were the class of drugs that were most likely to be cost
effective. The committee therefore prioritised this class of drugs for these people. As
before, there was greater certainty in the results for people with established
cardiovascular disease compared with those at high risk of developing cardiovascular
disease, and the rationale for referring to SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular
benefit also applies here.
Some people will have established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing
cardiovascular disease, but not be able to take an SGLT2 inhibitor or metformin. There was
no evidence specifically for this group so the committee made the same assumption as
above (that these people would take the next most effective and cost-effective
treatment). The committee did not recommend a specific drug for these people because
GLP-1 mimetics were not cost-effective options in this situation (see the rationale and
impact section on why GLP-1 mimetics were not recommended as first-line treatment).
They agreed that in practice prescribers would use their clinical judgement to choose an
appropriate treatment from the remaining options, based on the individual clinical
circumstances and needs of the person with type 2 diabetes (see recommendation 1.7.1).
Safety considerations for SGLT2 inhibitors
The committee noted some particularly important safety considerations to take into
account before an adult with type 2 diabetes starts on an SGLT2 inhibitor. The committee
highlighted these because the SGLT2 inhibitors are comparatively new drugs and clinical
experience with them is low in primary care, but the new recommendations are expected
to greatly increase their use in this setting. In the committee's experience there have been
multiple instances of avoidable diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) resulting in hospital admission.
The committee highlighted some factors that might put someone at higher risk of DKA, but
the list is not intended to be exhaustive. Addressing modifiable risk factors before starting
an SGLT2 inhibitor could reduce the risk of DKA and make the drug safer for the person
with type 2 diabetes.
The committee were aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 44 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
may wish to try a ketogenic diet to reverse or reduce the severity of their diabetes or
induce remission. However, the committee agreed, based on their experience, that there
may be an increased risk of DKA associated with SGLT2 inhibitors and such diets. It is
important to tell people about these risks and to advise them to discuss any planned
change to a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet with their healthcare professional
first.
Why GLP-1 mimetics were not recommended as first-line treatment
The committee did not recommend a GLP-1 mimetic as first-line treatment for the
following reasons:
• GLP-1 mimetics were not cost effective as a class at this (or any) stage of treatment
for people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease or with established
cardiovascular disease.
• Although the ICERs for injectable semaglutide for the various modelled scenarios and
stages of treatment fell within a similar range to the ICERs for the individual SGLT2
inhibitors, there was more certainty that the SGLT2s were cost effective as a class. In
contrast, the ICERs for injectable semaglutide increased significantly in a sensitivity
analysis, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the results.
• There were differences in clinical effectiveness between the injectable and oral forms
of semaglutide compared with placebo for some outcomes, such as all-cause
mortality, based on the evidence from the trials. However, the committee agreed it
was uncertain whether the observed differences in effect were real or might be
related to the relatively small size and low event rates in these trials compared with
other trials included in the review, which resulted in wide 95% confidence intervals
around the effect estimates for some outcomes.
• The committee concluded that the factors above combined to give such a high level of
uncertainty around the clinical and cost effectiveness of injectable semaglutide that
they could not make a positive recommendation for its use.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations to offer SGLT2 inhibitors with metformin to adults with type 2
diabetes and chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at
first-line treatment (or if they are already taking metformin monotherapy) are expected to
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 45 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
lead to a change in practice and increase the number of people taking SGLT2 inhibitors at
the beginning of their treatment. This is also expected to be the case for people with a
high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as this category is expected to cover a
large proportion of adults with type 2 diabetes. In current practice, these people would not
be offered combination therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor until additional treatment is
needed to control their HbA1c to below their individually agreed threshold for intervention,
and then only if they met the criteria in the relevant NICE technology appraisals for being
prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor. Overall, this recommendation is expected to greatly
increase the number of people taking SGLT2 inhibitors and is likely to have a substantial
resource impact.
The number of adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure or established
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease
who cannot tolerate metformin, or for whom metformin is contraindicated, are expected to
be relatively low. The new recommendations are likely to see a change in practice as more
people start taking an SGLT2 inhibitor, and this will likely be associated with a resource
impact.
The recommendations about how to begin combination therapy, factors to check before a
person starts on an SGLT2 inhibitor, and topics to cover in a conversation with the person,
are not expected to significantly increase consultation time or be a change in practice
because these should already form part of the prescribing process. Checking that the
person is not at increased risk of DKA when they are prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor should
help reduce the number of people who experience DKA and thereby reduce unnecessary
hospital admissions.
Return to recommendations
Reviewing drug treatments
Recommendations 1.7.14 to 1.7.16
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee agreed that when changes to treatment are being considered it is
important to review existing treatment options first. Stopping medications that have not
worked, for example, in controlling blood glucose or weight loss, and optimising current
treatments may remove the need to prescribe additional drugs. However, some drugs,
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 46 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
such as SGLT2 inhibitors, may be continued because they provide additional
cardiovascular protective benefits. In particular, there might be reasons, such as problems
with adherence or adverse effects, that might make existing treatments less effective or
ineffective. Addressing these might mean that adding a new drug is unnecessary.
The list of factors to think about as part of optimisation is not exhaustive but includes
those that the committee thought were particularly important. The committee agreed that
it is important to revisit advice about diet and lifestyle because part of this discussion is to
ensure the person is supported with both non-pharmacological and pharmacological
interventions to improve their current health and prognosis.
Reviews should also take into account a person's current clinical circumstances (as
detailed in recommendation 1.7.1 on choosing drug treatments). This will help ensure that
appropriate treatment options are considered if the person's clinical situation has
changed: for example, if it has improved because of weight loss or if they have developed
chronic heart failure or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
When people with an elevated lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease turn 40, their
cardiovascular risk may appear to drop when it is assessed using QRISK2. However, this is
due to switching from assessing lifetime risk to a 10-year risk calculation rather than an
actual decrease in cardiovascular risk. SGLT2 inhibitor treatment should not be stopped for
this reason alone.
Based on the evidence and the economic model, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors were not
confined to first-line treatment for people with elevated cardiovascular risk or chronic
heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. To ensure that people
who are already on drug therapy (including those people who have started first-line
treatment, and those people who are further along the treatment pathway and are taking
dual or triple therapy) for type 2 diabetes can have an SGLT2 inhibitor if their level of
cardiovascular risk is sufficiently high or they have chronic heart failure or established
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the committee included a separate
recommendation on SGLT2 inhibitors for these people. As explained in the rationale for
recommendations on first-line treatment, the committee specified SGLT2 inhibitors with
proven cardiovascular benefits.
This recommendation also takes into account that adults with type 2 diabetes may
develop these conditions (or an increase in their risk) over time. If that happens, an SGLT2
inhibitor could then be of benefit to them. The committee agreed that it was very

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
important to highlight that it may be more appropriate to replace an existing therapy with
an SGLT2 inhibitor than to add to it, depending on the person's circumstances. This is
because they were aware that treatment optimisation as detailed in recommendation 1.7.14
is not always carried out in practice.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendation about reviewing drug treatment is not expected to be a change in
practice or to need substantial additional resources because these conversations should
already take place. However, the wider use of SGLT2 inhibitors in people who are already
being treated for type 2 diabetes and who have or develop high cardiovascular risk or
chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is expected to
lead to an increase in resource use.
Return to recommendations
Treatment options if further interventions are
needed
Recommendations 1.7.17 to 1.7.23
Why the committee did not make any new recommendations in
2022
The committee did not make any new recommendations on further treatment options.
They agreed that for later stages of treatment, separate recommendations were not
needed for people at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease or with chronic heart
failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This was for several reasons.
Firstly, the evidence and the economic model continued to show that an SGLT2 inhibitor
was likely to be the most cost-effective option for these people. Secondly, the
recommendations they had made on first-line treatment using an SGLT2 inhibitor (either
with metformin, or alone if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated) and for switching
or adding this drug at later stages meant that these people would be able to access an
SGLT2 inhibitor without adding this consideration to the existing 2015 recommendations.
Finally, the alternative treatment options for people with and without increased

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
cardiovascular risk remained the same for later treatment stages. Therefore, the
committee agreed to retain the existing 2015 recommendations for treatment options if
further interventions are needed, without making any changes based on cardiovascular
risk.
To simplify treatment options, the committee merged recommendations for people in
whom metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated into the existing 2015
recommendations where possible, and added the NICE technology appraisals as bullet
points to the relevant existing recommendations.
The evidence reviewed in this update was limited to the cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1
mimetics and the committee agreed that this was only generalisable to people with a high
risk of developing cardiovascular disease or with chronic heart failure or established
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. As for first-line treatment, GLP-1 mimetics as a
class were not cost-effective options for later stages of treatment, and there was too
much uncertainty in the clinical and cost effectiveness to support recommending
injectable semaglutide (see the rationale and impact section on first-line drug treatment).
The committee did not look at clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence for the use of
GLP-1 mimetics to control blood glucose levels. As a result, the committee were unable to
update the 2015 GLP-1 mimetic recommendations in this update. However, the committee
were concerned that, as written, the 2015 recommendation on GLP1-mimetics would mean
that people taking newer drugs with proven cardiovascular benefit, such as SGLT2
inhibitors, would have to switch to a combination of metformin, a sulfonylurea and a GLP-1
mimetic. They agreed that this might be clinically inappropriate and not in keeping with
current clinical practice, so they amended recommendation 1.7.21 to remove the
requirement for this specific combination of treatment options. The rest of the
recommendation and the other recommendations for GLP-1 mimetics were out of scope
for this update, so the criteria for accessing a GLP-1 mimetic remain unchanged. These
recommendations set tight limits on who should be offered a GLP-1 mimetic, based on the
lack of cost effectiveness of this treatment for most people in the 2015 guideline.
How the recommendations might affect practice
Since no new drug options have been added to later stages of treatment, these
recommendations are not expected to lead to an increase in resource impact over that
detailed above for starting drug treatment with metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor, or an
SGLT2 inhibitor alone, or for people who are already on drug therapy when an SGLT2

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
inhibitor is or becomes appropriate based on their cardiovascular risk.
Removing the previous restriction limiting the use of GLP-1 mimetics to combination
therapy with metformin and a sulfonylurea may increase the use of GLP-1 mimetics at later
stages of the treatment pathway by making additional combinations of triple therapy that
include GLP-1 mimetics available to eligible people. However, these drugs are already
widely used in some areas and this change may bring the guideline into line with current
practice.

Long-acting insulin
Recommendations 1.7.30 to 1.7.32
Why the committee made the recommendations
Biosimilars have the potential to offer the NHS considerable cost savings. To gain approval
for use, biosimilar medicines have to be shown to be safe and as effective as the original
reference medicine, and have the same quality. Based on this understanding, the
committee noted it was appropriate when starting a new prescription of an insulin where a
biosimilar is available, to use the one with the lowest cost.
Additionally, people may be using an insulin for which a lower cost biosimilar is available. In
such cases, the committee recommended discussing with people the possibility of
switching to the biosimilar. This could happen at the person's routine review. They also
agreed that switching to the biosimilar should be carefully planned, taking into
consideration the dose-switching protocols, monitoring and the person's concerns about
switching from their existing regimen, and a shared decision reached. Healthcare
professionals should also refer to the summary of product characteristics for further
information when considering switching to biosimilars.

SGLT2 inhibitors for adults with type 2 diabetes
and chronic kidney disease
Recommendations 1.8.16 to 1.8.20
Why the committee made the recommendations
Strong evidence from well-conducted randomised controlled trials showed that SGLT2
inhibitors reduced the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, mortality and
cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD.
Economic modelling for people with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) above 30 mg/mol
at baseline showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were likely to be both more effective and cost
saving in this group compared with standard treatment.
People with a baseline ACR of 3 mg/mmol to 30 mg/mmol will experience fewer
cardiovascular events and events relating to CKD progression than people with a higher
ACR. Because of this, SGLT2 inhibitors would prevent fewer events for this group in
absolute terms, even if the relative effect was the same. Economic modelling showed that
SGLT2 inhibitors were still likely to be both more effective and cost saving in people with a
baseline ACR of between 3 mg/mol and 30 mg/mol compared with standard treatment.
However, there was more uncertainty around the clinical and cost effectiveness in this
group than in people with a baseline ACR over 30 mg/mmol. Because of this, SGLT2
inhibitors may not be suitable for everyone with a baseline ACR of between 3 mg/mmol
and 30 mg/mmol, and the committee made a different recommendation for this group.
There was no evidence specifically looking at the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors for
people with a baseline ACR of less than 3 mg/mol, so the committee made a
recommendation for research for this group.
The committee cautioned that SGLT2 inhibitors are not suitable for everyone and should
only be used within their marketing authorisation.
Some ethnic groups have a higher risk of micro- and macrovascular complications and so
may benefit more from SGLT2 inhibitors. However, no evidence was found that stratified
data by ethnicity. To address this gap, the committee made a recommendation for
research.

For an explanation of why the committee recommended angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, see the section on
pharmacotherapy in NICE's guideline on chronic kidney disease.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations will lead to a significant change in practice, since SGLT2 inhibitors
will be prescribed more widely. This will result in a substantial cost impact. The committee
noted, however, that there was likely to be a long-term cost saving from reduced
downstream treatment costs, as SGLT2 inhibitors slow CKD progression and reduce the
number of cardiovascular and end-stage renal events.

Periodontitis
Recommendations 1.8.1 to 1.8.4
Why the committee made the recommendations
The evidence showed that people with diabetes are at increased risk of periodontitis, and
that non-surgical periodontal treatment can improve diabetes control. However, in the
committee's experience, people with diabetes are often unaware of this and may not be
having regular oral health reviews. To address this, the committee recommended routinely
discussing the risk of periodontitis at annual reviews, alongside eye disease and foot
problems.
The evidence also showed that periodontal treatment is cost effective for people with type
2 diabetes, assuming improvements in HbA1c are maintained. This was tested with health
economic modelling in a range of different scenarios. There were some scenarios where
periodontal treatment was not cost effective, but the committee did not think these
scenarios reflected real-world practice.
How the recommendations might affect practice
For oral healthcare professionals, the long-term impact of the recommendations is
uncertain. The recommendations specify that people should follow existing NICE

guidelines on oral health. However, the recommendations may also increase awareness of
periodontitis, leading to a possible short-term increase in the number of oral health
reviews. Any increase in the number of oral health reviews will potentially impact on
services, as NHS dental services already have capacity issues.
A short-term increase in the number of oral health reviews will also lead to a short-term
increase in costs. However, there is likely to be a larger long-term reduction in costs from
the improvement to oral health and diabetes control.
Oral healthcare and dental teams will need clear advice on what they need to do for
people with diabetes. They will need clear care pathways to improve quality of care and
service delivery, in line with the NHS England commissioning standard on dental care for
people with diabetes.
Many people do not have regular oral health reviews, even if they are eligible for free NHS
dental care. People are eligible for free dental care if they are:
• pregnant
• mothers with babies under 1 year old
• on low income benefits, or under 20 and dependent on someone who is receiving low
income benefits
• having treatment in an NHS hospital by the hospital dentist.
The recommendations may encourage more people with diabetes to have regular oral
health reviews. Combined with proactive engagement and enhanced support for people
with diabetes, this may broaden access to dental and oral healthcare and help to reduce
oral health inequalities.

Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
Context
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition characterised by insulin resistance (that
is, the body's inability to effectively use insulin) and insufficient pancreatic insulin
production, resulting in high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia). Type 2 diabetes is
commonly associated with obesity, physical inactivity, raised blood pressure, periodontitis,
disturbed blood lipid levels and a tendency to develop thrombosis, and is therefore
recognised to have an increased cardiovascular risk. It is associated with long-term
microvascular and macrovascular complications, together with reduced quality of life and
life expectancy.
In 2019, approximately 3.2 million adults in the UK had diagnosed diabetes. About 90% of
these people had type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is more common in people of African,
African-Caribbean and South Asian family background. It can occur in all age groups and is
increasingly being diagnosed in adolescents and young adults.
Multiple vascular risk factors and wide-ranging complications make diabetes care complex
and time-consuming, and many areas of healthcare services must be involved for optimal
management. Necessary lifestyle changes, and the complexities and possible side effects
of therapy, make structured education and self-management important aspects of
diabetes care. Diabetes care is estimated to account for at least 5% of UK healthcare
expenditure, and up to 10% of NHS expenditure.
This guideline contains recommendations for managing type 2 diabetes in adults, and
focuses on education, dietary advice, managing cardiovascular risk, managing blood
glucose levels, and identifying and managing long-term complications. The guideline does
not cover diagnosis, secondary diabetes, type 1 diabetes in adults, diabetes in pregnancy
or diabetes in children and young people.

Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
Update information
June 2022: We reviewed evidence on periodontitis in people with type 2 diabetes, and
made new recommendations. These recommendations are marked [2022].
March 2022: We reviewed the evidence on continuous glucose monitoring for adults with
type 2 diabetes. These recommendations are marked [2022].
We also made one change without an evidence review: in the section on self-monitoring of
capillary blood glucose, the word 'capillary' has been added to the heading and
recommendations, to make it clear that recommendations apply to adults who are using
capillary blood glucose monitoring rather than CGM. These recommendations are marked
[2015, amended 2022].
Recommendations are marked to show when they last had an evidence review, for
example [2009] or [2015]. In some cases, minor changes have been made to the wording
to bring the language and style up to date, without changing the meaning.
We also added a cross-reference to NICE's technology appraisal guidance on dapagliflozin
for treating chronic kidney disease in the section on managing complications.
February 2022: We reviewed the evidence and made new recommendations on drug
treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. These recommendations are marked [2022].
We also made some changes without an evidence review:
• We have replaced 'individually agreed threshold for intensification' throughout with
'individually agreed threshold for further intervention' for clarity. (Intensification was
also removed from recommendation for research 3.)
• In recommendation 1.1.1 we have removed 'because of reduced life expectancy'.
• Figure 1: Your target HbA1c: weighing it up has been added to the guideline as a tool
that people can choose to use to help them discuss their HbA1c target with their
healthcare professional.
• In recommendation 1.7.1 contraindications and weight have been added as examples to
the bullet point about individual clinical circumstances. Monitoring requirements has

conditions#notice-of-rights). 58
Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
been added as a separate bullet, and cardiovascular and renal protection have been
added to bullet point 3 on effectiveness of the drug treatments.
• Recommendation 1.7.10 was amended to make it clear that it applies to people who are
not in either of the high cardiovascular risk groups in recommendation 1.7.9. The NICE
technology appraisals have been added as a bullet point to show that they may be
treatment options at this stage. Information on repaglinide has been removed from the
guideline.
• 'Initial drug treatment with metformin' was changed to 'monotherapy' in
recommendation 1.7.18 because people may now be taking an SGLT2 inhibitor as
monotherapy at this stage. The bullets have been simplified to show which drug could
be added (rather than stating combinations) and the NICE technology appraisals have
been added as a bullet point.
• The bullets in recommendation 1.7.19 have been simplified to show which drug could
be added (rather than stating combinations) and the NICE technology appraisals have
been added as a bullet point.
• In recommendation 1.7.21 'consider combination therapy with metformin, a sulfonylurea
and a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic' was changed to 'consider triple
therapy by switching one drug for a GLP-1 mimetic' to reflect that people might be
taking an SGLT2 inhibitor.
These recommendations are marked [2015, amended 2022].
November 2021: We reviewed the evidence and made new recommendations on SGLT2
inhibitors for adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. They are marked
[2021].
December 2020: We amended recommendations 1.8.25 and 1.8.28 to bring them in line
with the diabetic eye screening programme. The evidence for these recommendations has
not been reviewed, and they are marked [2009, amended 2020].
August 2019: The recommendations in section 1.4 on diagnosing and managing
hypertension have been removed because diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of
hypertension is broadly the same for people with type 2 diabetes as for other people (see
the NICE guideline on hypertension in adults). When a different approach is needed for
people with type 2 diabetes, this is specified in the hypertension guideline.

Type 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)
December 2015: We updated and replaced NICE guideline CG87 (published May 2009)
and NICE technology appraisal guidance 203 and 248. We made a change without an
evidence review. The recommendation on the treatment of gastroparesis was replaced by
recommendations from the NICE guideline on type 1 diabetes. This change is labelled
[2015].
Minor changes since publication
March 2025: Links were updated following publication of NICE's guideline on overweight
and obesity management.
August 2024: We added a link to NICE's guideline on diabetic retinopathy in the section on
managing complications.
August 2022: We added a new recommendation to the section on reviewing drug
treatments, to clarify what to do for adults who start taking an SGLT2 inhibitor before they
are 40. This recommendation is marked [2022].
We also updated the visual summary following stakeholder feedback. See the tables on
summary of first-line medicines and on summary of medicines for further treatment.
May 2022: We added a link to NICE's guideline on medicines associated with dependence
or withdrawal symptoms in the section on autonomic neuropathy.
December 2019: Relationships to the NICE guideline on hypertension were clarified, and a
link was added to the decision aid on choice of medicine to control blood glucose. We
added a link to the patient decision aid and user guide about taking a second medicine to
control blood glucose.
June 2018: Recommendation 1.3.11 was added to provide a link to NICE's advice on
bariatric surgery.
